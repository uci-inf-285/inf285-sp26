    <p>
       Policies and background for IN4MATX 285, Spring 2026 Quarter. 
       <span class="tbd">All syllabus content is subject to change, particularly prior to the start of the quarter.</span>
    </p>
    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>From the <a href="http://catalogue.uci.edu/search/?P=IN4MATX%20285">catalog</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>Technologies, languages, and skills required for creating prototypes to communicate interactive technology concepts. Topics include HTTP, CSS, CSS scripting, AJAX, Design Patterns, Javascript, Javascript libraries such as jQuery, SQL, MVC, and cloud architectures.</blockquote>
    <p></p>
    <p>In practice, every instructor takes a slightly different bend to these topics. I focus on covering modern technologies for web development, which includes some of the topics described above but not all.</p>
    <p>This course is restricted to MHCID students. All students must have taken <a href="http://catalogue.uci.edu/search/?P=IN4MATX%20285">IN4MATX 285</a> with a B or higher.</p>
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Implement basic interactive websites in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
    <li>Be conversant with developers on more complex technical concepts such as frontend versus backend development, storage, and authentication.</li>
    <li>Follow principles for working effectively with developers such as using version control and code libraries.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Course Format</h2>
<p>This course is primarily asynchronous, with two recorded lectures posted each week. Each week will have a lecture covering a <em>Programming</em> concept, and a separate lecture covering a principle of code development in <em>Practice</em>. We will try to post the recordings at least a week ahead of the date stated on the course <a href="/calendar">calendar</a>, and you can choose when to watch the recorded lectures.</p>
<p>Daniel will have two scheduled synchronous sessions each week. The first session will be a Live Demo related to topics covered in that week's Programming Lecture. The second session will be Office Hours for discussing Practice concepts or any content related to the Assignments. Course TAs will have weekly office hours as well. Attendance at these synchronous sessions is optional, though highly recommended if you have questions. The Live Demos will generally be recorded and recordings will be posted. Office Hours will not be recorded.</p>
<p>In addition to these synchronous sessions, the course staff will be available to respond to questions over Slack. When possible, please post your questions to the public channels on Slack, as this can help others learn from your responses.</p>
<p>Additional synchronous meetings may be possible by appointment. But we will largely encourage students to go to one of the staff's office hours or communicating over Slack.</p>
<h2>Required Text and Materials</h2>
<p>Given the rapid changes in web and mobile development, any materials relying on a particular technology will quickly lose their value as a reference material. Articles online serve as a great resource, and all required materials will be made available. Check the <a href="/resources">resources</a> tab for some pointers, and feel free to send the course staff any resources you find useful as the course progresses.</p>
<h2>Keeping in Touch</h2>
<p>Use the Course Slack channel within the MHCID Slack for communicating with one another.</p>
<p>We also have an email address for the coure staff <a href="mailto:informatics-285-staff@uci.edu">informatics-285-staff&#64;uci.edu</a>. When you do send an email, please send it to the course list rather than emailing Daniel directly. Doing so will help ensure the message does not get lost and will help the entire course staff stay informed.</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Grading breakdown is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>80% Assignments</li>
    <ul>
        <li>25% A1: Widget Factory</li>
        <li>25% A2: Accessible Course Registrar</li>
        <li>30% A3: Browser Plugin</li>
    </ul>
    <li>20% Participation (up to 5% extra credit)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>20% Responses to Practice Lectures</li>
        <li>5% Slack or Synchronous Participation</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Assignments</h3>
<p>Each assigment has checkpoints every week or two, and describes how grades will be broken down among the checkpoints.</p>
<h3>Participation</h3>
<p>As all Programming and Practice Lectures are recorded, there are no synchronous attendance requirements. For each <em>Practice Lecture</em>, instead post a short reflection (on the order of two sentences) to Canvas via the <a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/71825/discussion_topics">discussion board</a>. Reflections can address, for example, your prior experiences with the topic, or how the practice described might influence your collaborations with developers in the future. Reflections are only required for the <em>Practice Lectures</em>, as the <em>Programming Lectures</em> will instead assist as you work through the assignments. One reflection will be dropped, e.g., you can miss one reflection and still receive full credit.</p>
<p>Asking and answering questions can help both you and others learn! Up to 5% of extra credit can be earned from responding to questions posed by others on Slack or posing questions during the synchronous coding demos. Extra credit will be given holistically, based on participation across the whole quarter.</p>
<h3 id="duedates">Due Dates</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, all assignments are due "at the end of the day" on whatever date is listed on the calendar. In practice, we will implement this on Canvas as 11:59pm Pacific <strong>(note time zone)</strong> that day.</p>
<p>Late assignments will be assessed a 15% penalty for each 24-hour period after the due date. Assignments more than two days late will not be accepted without advance permission.</p>
<p><strong>The course staff is willing to grant extensions within reason when requested</strong>. We ask that you don't request extensions when they are not necessary, as assignments build on one another and delays can snowball. We will primarily approve extensions for final submissions of assignments, as check-ins and other intermediate work are graded on completion. Please upload whatever you are able to complete before the deadline, but feel free to continue working as necessary.</p>
<p>To request an extension, email the course staff at least 24 hours before the assignment due date. Late extension requests may be accommodated in exceptional circumstances, but shouldn't be expected. Include in your email when you now plan to submit the assignment. A typical extension would be for a few days, a week at most. To ensure that we can submit final grades on time, <strong>we will not grant extensions on the last part of the final assignment</strong>. We also reserve the right to refuse any extension (a second extension for the same assignment, for example).</p>
<h3>Re-grading</h3>
<p>If you would like part of your assignment to be re-graded, email the course staff list. Please explain what part of the grading rubric you feel your solution follows, but points were not granted. Please email regrades within a week of grades being posted; we reserve the right to decline regrade requests which come after this deadline.</p>
<p>Areas may be curved to ensure grades align with student successes toward learning objectives. We expect any curve would be "up" rather than "down".</p>
<h2 id="resources">Online Resources, Generative AI, and Collaboration</h2>
<p>In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.</p>
<p>While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. <strong>To be clear: looking at or submitting a student's assignment from a previous course offering is not allowed.</strong> If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!</p>
<p>Generative AI (OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Microsoft CoPilot, etc.) poses a challenge in a class like this. Such tools can be a helpful resource, but can also be an impediment to deep understanding of the course topics. You are <strong>permitted to use Generative AI systems</strong>, such as asking for advice on how to implement an assignment feature, but you <strong>must cite what you asked and what sort of response you got</strong> (at a high level, we don't need to see each individual query). That said, we expect these tools may be less useful than anticipated. The current interaction paradigm requires asking questions about exactly what you want implemented, at which point it may be faster or easier to implement it yourself.</p>
<p>Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else's code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.</p>
<p>The CSE department at the University of Washington, where Daniel completed his Ph.D., had the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilligan%27s_Island">Gilligan's Island rule</a>:</p>
<blockquote>After discussing with someone, get rid of all written records of the collaboration (no whiteboards, email, paper, etc.) and then engage in a totally unrelated activity like watching Gilligan's Island before returning to the work.</blockquote>
<p>In essence, feel free to talk to others, but take a break to ensure you've learned from the collaboration rather than copied. The reference is dated, swap it out for whatever Netflix show or other activity you're in to.</p>
<h2 id="integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Our hope is that you're excited to build user interfaces and want to follow good principles for doing so. Our job as the course staff is to help facilitate your learning. The assignments and participation requirements in this course are designed to help toward that learning. Naturally, there will be ways to shortcut this learning to arrive at a desirable solution with the least amount of effort. But by doing so, you're missing the opportunity to learn the topics.</p>
<p>As discussed above, acknowledge your sources. Attempting to pass someone else's work off as your own is not allowed. If you do so, you will receive a failing grade for the assignment or the entire course at the instructor's discretion. The course staff will report the incident to UCI's Office of Academic Integrity &amp; Student Conduct. What will follow will be unpleasant, just don't do it.</p>
<p>If you're having problems in this course, come talk to the course staff. The shortcut isn't worth it.</p>
<p>For more info, take a look at <a href="https://aisc.uci.edu/students/academic-integrity/index.php">UCI's academic integrity policy</a> and <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism">ACM's</a>. Talk to the course staff if you have additional questions.</p>
<p>As an instructor, allowing students to share their work online, such as publicly on GitHub, poses a dilemma. The benefit is that it can contribute to your web presence, offering a browseable portfolio piece to potential employers. But it can also serve as an online resource for other current or future students to copy from, rather than learn from. We ask that you do not make your work in this class visible online unless it it distinguishably different from the course assignment (e.g., an extended Browser Plugin).</p>
<h2>Accomodations</h2>
