    <h1>A2: Department Course Report in JavaScript</h1>
        <p>In this assignment, you are helping UCI's Deparment of Informatics to better make sense of the courses that they are teaching. You will do so by improving upon the functionality provided in UCI's online Schedule of Classes, called <a href="https://www.reg.uci.edu/perl/WebSoc">WebSoc</a>. According to WebSoc's footer, their website was implemented way back in 2007. It even lists a fax number, I wonder if that is still used...</p>
        <p>This assignment has three parts, with a part due each week. In the first week (<a href="assignments/a2#summary">Part 1</a>), you will first implement a summary of the course data. You will then implement responsive functionality (<a href="assignments/a2#responsive">Part 2</a>) and filtering and search features (<a href="assignments/a2#filter">Part 3</a>). This assignment is worth <strong>25 points</strong>, distributed among the three parts. The assignment parts are intentionally independent; you can move on to a later part of the assignment without completing an earlier part. However, the final part offers an opportunity to revise earlier parts for partial credit.</p>
        <h2>Starter Code</h2>
        <p>The code is available for download <a href="https://github.com/uci-inf-285/a2-course-report">on GitHub</a>. Just like with A1, you can choose to create your own repository or download the code directly.</p>
        <h3>Repository Structure</h3>
        <p>You only need to edit one code file, <code>script.js</code>, to complete this assignment. This file contains seven functions which will need updating. This script file is loaded by <code>index.html</code>, which you can open up directly in your browser for debugging. There is also a <code>readme.docx</code> to add some context about your submission.</p>
        <p>Two additional script files include data about the courses in the term. <code>static_courses.js</code> provides a list of courses, their instructors, etc. <code>static_courses_full.js</code> extends this list to also provide a list of all activities associated with each course (lectures, discussion sections, etc.). But as a result, it is longer and harder to make sense of. Just like in A1, you will not need to edit the <code>.gitignore</code>, and we also provided a <code>favicon.ico</code>. We provide an additional <code>parsing</code> folder which includes the source webpage from WebSoc and a script for parsing it written in <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a>. This script has not been extensively tested, but may be useful if you decide to extend the assignment.</p>
        <p>Just like for A1, we recommend <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> to edit your <code>script.js</code> file and browse the other files.</p>
        <h2 id="summary">Part 1: {{assignments[0].name}}</h2>
        <h3>Due {{assignments[0].dueStr}} PST</h3>
        <p>For the first part of the assignment, implement the Department Summary for the Spring quarter. Here, you will implement functions in your <code>script.js</code> file to count up how many classes the department is offering four categories: lower division undergraduate, upper division undergraduate, MHCID, and PhD. You will also use code to count up the total number of courses offered.</p>
        <p>You will need to implement five functions for this part. Four functions simply return whether a course passed in as an argument is a class of that type (<code>isUndergradLowerDiv</code>, <code>isUndergradUpperDiv</code>, <code>isMHCID</code>, <code>isPhD</code>). The fifth function, <code>makeSummary</code>, is where you will implement the logic for summarizing the courses offered, in part by calling the other four functions.</p>
        <p>Like most (all?) universities, UCI has a standard convention for how courses are numbered, described in the <a href="https://catalogue.uci.edu/about/about.pdf">General Catalogue</a>. Of particular note is that Undgergraduate course are split between lower-division (numbered 1-99) and upper-division (numbered 100-199). Typically, lower-division is for freshmen and sophomore courses, while upper-division is for junior and senior courses. Graduate (like PhD) and professional courses are 200 and above, with MHCID courses being 280-289. For simplicity, you can assume that all PhD courses are 200-279. WebSoc lists a few additional individual study courses, like IN4MATX 199 and 290, which do not show up in our lists. You can safely ignore these courses; we have intentionally removed them to simplify parsing/presentation.</p>
        <p>The two static files load JavaScript variables with arrays, where each array element contains details about each course: the course title, instructor, number of students enrolled, number of units, etc. The <code>courses</code> variable provided in <code>static_courses.js</code> provides a short overview. The <code>courses_full</code> variable provided in <code>static_courses_full.js</code> extends each course with an <code>allClassActivities</code> array, containing specific details about when courses are offered and course locations. These two JavaScript files are loaded before your <code>script.js</code> file, so you can use these variables within your own code. Consider adding a log statement to your <code>makeSummary</code> function to test this out, such as <code>console.log(courses);</code>.</p>
        <p>Once you calculate the number of courses/enrollment for each classes, use JavaScript's DOM Manipulation features to update the counts displayed. The <code>index.html</code> page has specific IDs associated with the counts and enrollments for courses in each category. To help you debug your calculations, we can share some of the correct numbers for the provided file. There are <strong>3</strong> MHCID courses offered in Spring 2025 with <strong>132</strong> students enrolled (<strong>44</strong> of you in each class). The Department has <strong>3,416</strong> students enrolled in total.</p>
        <p>For grading, we will load up different <code>static_course.js</code> and <code>static_courses_full.js</code> files, so you will need to calculate these dynamically. To receive credit, you can't simply update <code>index.html</code> with the correct values. This is the value of programming: you can dynamically update content based on changing data!</p>
        <p>To submit, zip your code repository and upload it to <a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/71825/assignments/1557078">Canvas</a>.</p>
        <h3>Grading</h3>
        <p>This part of the assignment is worth <strong>5 points</strong>, and is graded on correctness (e.g., does the summary table display correct values for each course category). For partial credit, describe your progress in your <code>readme.docx</code> file, and consider using <code>console.log</code> statements to print your calculated totals. Any late uploads are subject to the course's <a href="/syllabus#duedates">late policy</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="responsive">Part 2: {{assignments[1].name}}</h2>
        <h3>Due {{assignments[1].dueStr}} PST</h3>
        <p>For the second part of the assignment, make the Courses section of the report <em>responsive</em>. This is a major limitation of WebSoc's current design--it is completely unreadable on mobile devices, and is still terrible on most other screens sizes! Responsivity is slighly improved in our current course report. By extending Bootstrap, our tables are the full width of each device, and the font size changes for different screen sizes. However, there is still significant text wrapping on small screens, and multiple rarely-used columns.</p>
        <img width="450px" class="image" src="assignments/a2_websoc.png"><img width="450px" class="image" src="assignments/a2_report_static.png">
        <p>You will implement the <code>makeResponsive</code> function for this part of the assignment. In this function, use JavaScript's DOM Manipulation features to add CSS Classes to the various header and body cells in each table. In particular, use Bootstrap's <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/display/">display properties</a> to hide certain less-useful columns on smaller screens.</p>
        <p>Exactly which columns to display on which screen size is up to you, with a few requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You must always display Instructor, Time, Place, and Enr (Enrollment) information.</li>
            <li>There must be some width where all 18 columns are visible.</li>
            <li>You must implement at least three breakpoints with progressively fewer columns as the screen size shrinks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The columns are defined in the <code>allClassActivities</code> dictionary in each entry of <code>courses_full</code> (intialized in <code>static_courses_full.js</code>). At the top of <code>script.js</code>, the variable <code>headerNames</code> is defined, which lists each column in the order that they are presented in the course report. It may be useful to refer back to this variable to decide which columns to show/hide at different screen sizes.</p>
        <p>Dynamic responsive design can be tested by re-sizing your browser window, or using your browser's inspector. Below is an example of a responsive layout with multiple breakpoints, though the columns presented do not fulfill the assignment requirements.</p>
        <img width="900px" src="assignments/a2_responsive.gif">
        <p>Finally, it's important to note that removing content is a bad practice for making pages responsive, as it's closer to <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/mobile-first">graceful degregation than progressive enhancement</a>. But it's hopefully a good demonstration of how responsiveness can be implemented in code.</p>
        <p>To submit, zip your code repository and upload it to <a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/71825/assignments/1557079">Canvas</a>. Include all files needed to run your webpage.</p>
        <p>This part of the the assignment is worth <strong>10 points</strong>, and is graded on correctness (e.g., does your responsive design fulfill the stated requrements). For partial credit, describe your progress in your <code>readme.docx</code> file Any late uploads are subject to the course's <a href="/syllabus#duedates">late policy</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="filter">Part 3: {{assignments[2].name}}</h2>
        <h3>Due {{assignments[2].dueStr}} PST</h3>
        <p>In the final part of this assignment, you will add dynamic <em>filter</em> and <em>search</em> functionality into the list of courses. To do so, you will implement the <code>makeFilter</code> function. We have provided the DOM functions to get the status of each checkbox and the search box text. We have set up this function to get called every time a person checks/uncheckx a box or enters/deletes text in the search box.</p>
        <img width="900px" src="assignments/a2_search.gif">
        <p>To implement filtering by checkboxes, you may find it helpful to reuse your course labeling functions from Part 1 (<code>isUndergradLowerDiv</code>, <code>isUndergradUpperDiv</code>, <code>isMHCID</code>, <code>isPhD</code>). The search box should implement searching by instructor name; WebSoc only provides the instructor's last name and first initial. Note that the example above implements filtering by both checkboxes and text search simultaneously, e.g., only showing search results which match both the text result and the appropriate checkboxes. Your code should do the same.</p>
        <p>If you are coming into this class with a background in programming or development, you may want to consider extending your assignment in different ways. For example, you could download and incorporate enrollment data from prior quarters or years, or multiple departments, perhaps with the help of the code in the <code>parsing</code> folder. For in-person classes, you could also add dyanmic links to the Classroom Technologies page for the room, such as this one for <a href="https://classrooms.uci.edu/classrooms/dbh/dbh-1100/">DBH 1100</a>. We are open to other forms of extending the assignment for extra credit. Please contact the course staff if you have any ideas.</p>
        <p>To submit, zip your code repository and upload it to <a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/71825/assignments/1557080">Canvas</a>. Include all files needed to run your webpage.</p>
        <p>This part of the the assignment is worth <strong>10 points</strong>, with 5 points each for correct implementation of implementing by checkboxes and the search box. Any extensions to your assignment will be awarded up to 5 bonus points. For partial credit, describe your progress in your <code>readme.docx</code> file Any late uploads are subject to the course's <a href="/syllabus#duedates">late policy</a>.</p>
        <p>After this part, we expect that you probably have a better handle on JavaScript than you did at the beginning of the assignment. If you did not complete Parts 1 and/or 2, you may also go back to these parts and add functionality for partial points back. We are still deciding on the exact amount of points back, but expect that you should be able to get the bulk of the credit on prior parts. Please answer the question in your <code>readme.docx</code> to indicate that we should regrade these parts.</p>
